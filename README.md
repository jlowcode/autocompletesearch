# Fabrik List Auto Complete Search 

This implementation changes the already activated search box in a list, adding the autocomplete functionality that works from 2 or more letters. The functionality allows two ways to autocomplete, namely:

- From the elements that have been enabled to participate in the general search of the list.
- Based on recent or most frequent queries from users.

- `--do--*` : allows you to select the type of plugin you want, in this case the option "autocompletesearch" will be selected.

- `Description`: is an optional field to describe the functionality of the plugin, being very useful when there are several plugins of the same type.
